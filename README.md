### Repository for Google Summer of Code 2021 at TensorFlow

Project description is available here: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4760303897673728

### Abstract:   
TensorFlow Hub and Model Garden are the go-to resources for ML practitioners for quick and easy experimentation. This project aims to implement **RegNet-Y** from the paper "Designing Network Design Spaces" by Radosavovic et. al and publish the pre-trained models on TF-Hub. RegNet-Y provides improved inference latency and it can be scaled according to the requirements of the user.
